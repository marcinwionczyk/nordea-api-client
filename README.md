# Automaton Test Framework

I'm creating a Rust clone or Robot Test Framework version 7.0 (generic open source automation framework for 
acceptance testing, acceptance test driven development (ATDD), and robotic process automation (RPA))

Instead of Python as a base for keywords, I'm going to use Rhai scripting.
The main use is going to be API testing with reqwest package and UI testing with playwrigt

Automaton Test Framework is a generic open source automation framework for acceptance testing, acceptance test driven 
development (ATDD), and robotic process automation (RPA). It has simple plain text syntax and it can be extended easily 
with generic and custom libraries.

Automation Test Framework is operating system and application independent. It is implemented using Rust which is also 
the primary language to extend it. The framework has a rich ecosystem around it consisting of various generic libraries 
and tools that are developed as separate projects. For more information about Robot Framework and the ecosystem, 
see http://automaton.org (to be created ;).
