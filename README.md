# Nordea API Client

This is an unofficial library showing that you can create a client service in Rust, utilizing Nordea API.

Usage examples are visible in `mod tests` in `src/lib.rs`  

in order to compile this library, you should set an environment variable `EIDAS_PRIVATE_KEY_DIR` to `certs` folder 
containing `private-key.pk8` file. Checkout `certs/how_to_create_private_key.md` to see how to prepare such file.

I have created so far functions to authorize in personal segment, decoupled mode. 
My goal is to become a Rust Developer. 
Nordea has a wide range of available APIs so there is a lot of work to do. 
If you want to show interest, please [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/mwionczyk) and I will implement your desired Nordea API part.
